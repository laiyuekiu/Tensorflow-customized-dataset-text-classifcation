Therefore, with the aim of providing more opportunities for the next generation future, it is a must for high schools to allow their students to develop knowledge and skills in various contexts. 
Let us not forget that one talent should not be restricted to one category, or be based on one gender.
Specialising in limited areas of interest early does not necessarily reap positive effects the counterargument is that exploring a topic in great depth when still young established the foundation for expertise. 
If students are first equipped with different types of skills before embarking on a specialized journey in university, I am confident that they will be more likely to outperform their counterparts in their future workplace. 
In terms of providing a Comprehensive, learning experience, high school is an ideal platform where students gain rudimentary knowledge on an array of subjects.

Besides, it is not guaranteed that all students are capable of determining their vocation at such an early age, because they are still in the process of exploring and self-discovery. 
Yet, we still have to bear in mind that it takes a great deal of time for one to locate where his or her natural talents and passions converge. 
It is, therefore, not hard to envision that students will suffer from early specialisations, as they will be deprived of the freedom to voice their opinions, and even worse, falling prey to parental controls. 
Focusing on specific subjects prematurely will impede! students eventual freedom.
